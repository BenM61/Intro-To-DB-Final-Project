This is our final project of "Introduction To Databases", where we created our own DB (got the data from TMDB).
Unfortunetley the website was on uni servers so I can't upload screenshots of it.
My job (with Ofek) was to design our own DB, as well as setting it up (writing the scripts that fetch the data we want from TMDB)

*WASN'T DONE ALONE*
Rest of the group: Oded Kristianpoller, Mor Buchnik ,Ofek Bar, Yoav Gaulan
